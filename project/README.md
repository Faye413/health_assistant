# Health AI Baseline Project

## Project Overview
This project serves as a baseline benchmark for comparing an AI assistant designed for personal health management. The baseline method provides simple, rule-based recommendations based on user health data.

## Directory Structure
- **data/**: Directory for storing raw input data (e.g., Apple Health, EightSleep, Oura Ring).
- **preprocessing/**: Contains scripts to preprocess and clean data.
- **recommendations/**: Contains logic for generating basic recommendations.
- **output/**: Stores the printed recommendations and outputs.
- **database/**: Saves user data and interview results.

## Usage
1. Place the health data files in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and analyze data.
3. Run the recommendation module to generate and print recommendations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- json

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Running the Project
```bash
python preprocessing/process_data.py
python recommendations/generate_recommendations.py
```



Comprehensive Documentation for AI Health Analysis Project

Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced AI system that aids users in analyzing various biometric readings and personal data to generate personalized health recommendations. The system can process data from multiple sources such as photos, personality tests, social media analysis, and health metrics. This document outlines all the functionalities, explains data flow, and cites relevant industry research that supports our work.

System Architecture

The system processes incoming data from different sources, applies machine learning models to analyze the data, and outputs tailored health insights and recommendations. The key flow is as follows:

Input Data: User uploads include:

JPEG images (full-body photos)

Text data from messaging apps

Personality type data

Social media metadata

Processing:

Image classification and analysis (body shape, health level)

Sentiment analysis of text data

Personality analysis

Holistic analysis combining various health metrics

Output:

Comprehensive health recommendations and insights presented in a user-friendly format.

Detailed Function Documentation

1. analyze_body_image(image_path)

Description: Accepts a full-body image in JPEG format and uses ML models (e.g., MobileNetV2) to determine if the image is of a human body and classify health levels based on body contours.

Key Industry References: Leveraged state-of-the-art computer vision techniques for body shape recognition as validated by research in automated health diagnostics (e.g., Journal of Medical Internet Research).

2. analyze_aging_rate(aging_rate, ...)

Description: Analyzes various biometrics such as telomere length, cardiovascular health, and metabolic markers to assess the user's biological aging rate.

Supporting Research: The aging assessment logic is aligned with current findings in Nature Aging, emphasizing cellular health and lifestyle factors.

3. analyze_social_interaction(social_count, ...)

Description: Evaluates the quantity and quality of social interactions to provide mental health recommendations.

Cited Work: Supported by studies published in The Lancet Psychiatry, which highlight the positive impact of social connectivity on mental health.

4. analyze_perception_score(...)

Description: Considers perception scores, text sentiment, body image, and digital footprint (Instagram analysis) to generate holistic wellness insights.

Validation: Uses frameworks established in Psychological Science and Computational Social Science for interpreting subjective well-being.

Visualization Tools Used

Matplotlib: For plotting contour areas and body shape visualizations.

OpenCV: For image preprocessing and contour detection.

TensorFlow: To employ pre-trained MobileNetV2 for initial image classification.

Future Work and Enhancements

Integration with Wearable Devices: Real-time data analysis from wearables such as Oura Ring and Apple Watch.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enhanced text analysis for deeper sentiment insights.

User Feedback Loop: Implementing a mechanism where user feedback refines future recommendations.
